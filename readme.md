# ❄️ SNOW-CRASH

## 📝 About

**Snow Crash** is a cybersecurity project from **École 42**, designed as a **CTF** *(Capture The Flag)*.
The main goal of this project is to introduce students to various areas of cybersecurity through a series of practical challenges performed on a virtual machine *(VM)*.

Each CTF level enables participants to learn and practice specific skills to identify and exploit flaws in programs or systems, such as exploiting vulnerabilities, analyzing binary files, inspecting network traffic, or performing reverse engineering.

## 📂 Repository Content

This repository contains the writeups for each level. Each folder includes:

* **flag**: the flag to capture for the level.
* **README.md**: a detailed explanation of the level, including the steps taken to find the flag, the vulnerabilities exploited, and the tools used.
* **resources/** *(optional)*: supplementary files required to solve the challenge.

> ⚠️ Warning: These are not exhaustive solutions.

## ⚙️ Tools and Skills

Throughout the different levels, several tools and techniques are used to solve the challenges.

### 🛠️ Tools

* **Basic commands**: `ls`, `cat`, `find`, `grep`, `chmod`, `chown`.
* **Debugging and reverse engineering**: `strings`, `strace`, `gdb`, decompilers.
* **Network analysis and manipulation**: `nc`, `curl`, `tshark` / `Wireshark`.

### 🎯 Skills Developed

* Analyzing environments and understanding how systems and programs work.
* Detecting and identifying weaknesses or vulnerabilities.
* Exploiting vulnerabilities, including bypass techniques, code injection, program manipulation, and reverse engineering.
